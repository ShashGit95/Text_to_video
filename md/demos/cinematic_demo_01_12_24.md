* The table below shows a comparison of four types of text-to-video generating models.


| Model                 | text-to-video-ms-1.7b | zeroscope_v2_576w | Pika AI | zeroscope_v2_XL |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Watermark             | Yes, shutterstock     | No                | No      | No              |
| Google Collab Version | Free                  | Free              | Free    | Free            |
| MAX Video Length      | 25  sec               | 6   sec           | 1  sec  | 3    sec        |
| Language Supported    | Only English          | Only English      | English | Only English    |
| other                 |                       |                   |         |                 |
| System RAM            | 7 GB                  | 7.6 GB            |         | 11.2 GB         |
| GPU RAM               | 16 GB                 | 5.3 GB            |         | 12.7 GB         |


* All these models are free versions.

* It is necessary to have a relatively higher GPU and system RAM to generate a longer video with the upscaling part of the zeroscope_v2_X model.

* If we increase the length of the video, the required GPU and system RAM also increase.
