Do the following next for Project Deepfake
b. Shift to experimenting with how we can use text prompts to create videos

### Anuja

We started work on this, hopefully I can give a status update next week.
Since this is a part of Deepfake, I assume we will use the same slack channel?
If so, I will give instructions under the Deepfake channel for Project Cinematic going forward.

### Boomer

Awesome sounds good. I went ahead and created a new channel. Looking forward to making progress on this.

3. Do the following next for Project Deepfake
a. Shift to experimenting with how we can use text prompts to create videos. Look into how Pika Labs is doing it
b. Send me examples of more prompts being tested with the current MVP
c. Revew another way to create AI generated videos by reviewing this video here: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0arXjNNcu1/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Demo can be found [**here**](https://github.com/williamboomer87/cinematic/blob/main/md/demos/cinematic_demo_12_08_23.md)

We have the mvp now. We will continue further investigation and testing.

### Boomer

Awesome work that is very cool to see! Can you test different prompts and show me?

Thank you I am able to view the videos now. This looks good but why does it say Shutterstock on it?

I can remember Dev mentioning that they used Shutterstock to train the model. Let us investigate this further and update you.
Sounds good. We can't have videos saying Shutterstock. Alternatively if there is a way to remove that it would be ideal

Hi Chamika, Menaka,

Summary,
* It is hard to show adequate progress per project as each developer is working on 2 or more projects.
* We went from 1-week demo to 2-week demo schedule due to this resource allocation.
* I prefer to have 1 developer per project.

With that, I would like to have 3 interns for the following projects:

1. Deepfake
2. Snapshot
3. Yummet

Here is the current project status:

1. Capacity Ai - Praveen
2. Cinematic - Shashika
3. Deepfake - Shashika
4. Snapsopt - PAUSED (Dhanushka was doing this)
5. Yummet - Praveen & Shashika

regards,
Anuja

1 Please do the following for Project Cinematic:

a. Create a system design for the backend of this project. Let's aim to keep it very simple for now <br/> <br/>
b. This is the frontend UI for the project: https://www.figma.com/file/YygiHW3l49DqRBovfJFQWD/Project-Cinematic?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=w6S6OnDrK1n69a9Z-1 <br/> <br/>
c. I would like for the front end to be built using Next.js and placed into one repo. Then I would like the backend in another repo and for the AI model to be in its own repo as well. Let's keep this simple and organized. My plan is to give the frontend to Dinesh for him to build

### Anuja

Can you create a new excalidraw in neural-leap-workspace?

### Boomer

Yes, here you go: https://link.excalidraw.com/l/uBtKLXMlH/9MKnOPgDyoO
